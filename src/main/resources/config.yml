# Guild chunk claim settings
claim:
  # Minimum buffer distance between different guild territories (in chunks)
  # Uses Manhattan distance: |dx| + |dz| must be >= buffer-distance
  # Set to 0 to disable buffer (allows adjacent claims)
  # Default: 4 chunks
  buffer-distance: 4

  # Material costs for leveling up
  # Costs are procedurally generated per guild using weighted probability selection
  # Materials are defined via API with level ranges and probability curves
  # Defaults include:
  #   - Common materials (levels 1-50): Iron, Coal, Copper, Cobblestone, etc.
  #   - Uncommon materials (levels 20-75): Gold, Redstone, Lapis, Quartz, etc.
  #   - Rare materials (levels 40-100): Diamond, Emerald, Ender Pearl, etc.
  #   - Very rare materials (levels 70-100): Netherite, Nether Star, etc.
  #
  # Use the MaterialRegistry API to register custom materials with:
  #   - minLevel: Minimum guild level for material to appear
  #   - maxLevel: Maximum guild level for material to appear
  #   - baseAmount: Base quantity before exponential scaling
  #   - probability: Selection weight (higher = more likely)
